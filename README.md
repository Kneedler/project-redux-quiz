# Redux Quiz - Foxes ðŸ¦Š - Group 2

This week project was about learning about the global state using Redux.
We build a quiz game with a Netflix theme changing the state based on the user answers.

## The problem

We worked as a group in a more advanced way using a mob-programming aproach. Before starting the
project we used Figma to plan design, different styles and also how we should structure the website
with different components. We broked down the tasks that needed to be done and focused on prioritizing
the decided goals for the day.

We have been using styled components and Redux with the different hooks such as
useDispatch and useSelector to interact with the store.
